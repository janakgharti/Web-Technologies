    <p> In the player vs player shooting game PUBG, up to 100 players compete in a battle royale, a kind of massive last man standing deathmatch where players compete to survive as long as possible. Players have the option of participating in the match alone, in a pair, or as a small team of up to four individuals.
                This is a really awesome game that I played ever. I loved this game very much. This game was played in the world wide. This is very populer in all over the world.
